    "#### Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent advances in Machine Learning technology are starting to be integrated into mainstream software tools.  One example is security software, where a recent IDC vendor comparison report says:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"Some security vendors were excluded from this analysis because IDC considered the endpoint STAP product incomplete or lacking full integration into the overall offering for signatureless defense, security incident response, and remediation tools. For example, some products **lacked advanced machine learningâ€“based threat detection** at the time of this analysis.\" (emphasis added) - https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US42385717\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to specialized security software, Machine Learning is starting to be incorporated in more generic data analysis software, like the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack/current/) commonly used for software application log data collection, storage, and analysis.  This provides a \"force multiplier\" for IT staff to identify unusual or unexpected conditions that include operational and security issues as manifested in application logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These new Machine Learning techniques automatically and adaptively determine the \"normal\" behavior of systems, so \"anomalous\" events can be identified in near real-time (minutes) and trigger alerting for review by qualified staff, with enough context to guide them quickly to judge whether further investigation and remediation is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Proof Of Concept undertaken by HMH Labs demonstrates that while Machine Learning implementations for log analysis are still \"immature\" in that they require a fair amount of configuration effort to give maximal value, even non-Data Analysis specialists can quickly put together systems to uncover hidden value in application log data already being collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning will not eliminate the need for human judgment anytime soon, but it does enable delivery of pertinent information that make people more effective by doing the things computers are good at, like sifting through large amounts of data.  Everyone is familiar with the problem of 'information overload' and Machine Learning provides one powerful tool that will enable 'lean' organizations."

    "##### Last path length ML job\n",
    "\n",
    "The hard part of Machine Learning, like many other areas, is figuring out what questions to ask.  Data features pertinent to the problem need identification and metrics developed to allow them to be analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most obvious things about SQL injection attacks is that they typically involve tacking various SQL syntax onto URLs.  Apart from trying to recognize that this SQL syntax is unusual, a simple test of the length of the last component, for example the '5699' in '/api/carts/5699', might be enough to distinguish them.  The longest path component of normal Huan API calls is 'forgot_password_notification', 28 characters.  A sample SQL injection test can look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  /api/carts/5699%27riMfJs%3C%27%22%3EfQzUJf%29%20AND%205971%3D3322%20AND%20%281102%3D1102\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Minor additions were made to the log transformation scripts to calculate the length of the last path component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Centralized Logging ML jobs \"last_path_length\" and \"sql_injection_detection2\" were created to test this theory.  The first is a \"single metric\" job just tracking max(last_path_length) and the second a \"multi-metric\" job that adds detection of anomalous mean(status) that indicates high rates of HTTP errors.  These jobs do not filter by environment, production or integration, but [sql_injection_detection2](json:redacted) sets the environment as a \"partition field\", which helps interpretation of the source of anomalies.\n",
